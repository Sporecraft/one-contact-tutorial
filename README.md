oneContact.app demo
===================

Demonstration of the following Lightning capabilities:

* How to set Lookup or Master-Detail values using a custom input component
* How to pass an _action_ as an attribute to a custom component, to
  create an effect similar to `ui:button`'s `press` attribute
* How to initialize sObject attributes using Apex controller methods

To deploy the demo, simply copy and paste all of the source code
into your DE org, replacing references to the `ccmt` namespace with
your org's own package namespace.
